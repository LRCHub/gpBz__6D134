Dark Alley

I stand before you again
Open arms, a heart that needs to mend
I feel so alone
I couldn't get it through to myself and now I'm done

I pray that i make it home tonight
Wished that I left you out of sight
But I don't got it in me
To let [?] and my eyes go black

Dark alley
That's where you'll find me
Left alone and broken
With my hands up to the sky, reaching for you

This time I was quick to find you
I thought I was dead without you
I can hear your voice inside me
Crystal aura does surround you
There's bad times I'll surrender to
The night touch used to not remember
Nights I felt like death around you
And I cast that out into the nether now
Sever back there
Time moves forward
What here keeps me bound and tethered
Yes, I'll be there, darkest corner

Dark alley
That's where you'll find me
Left alone and broken
With my hands up to the sky, reaching for you

Leave me alone, haunt me
You wanna leave me alone and haunt me
Leave me alone, haunt me
You wanna leave me alone and haunt me

(Hands up) Tied down
You don't want to let me drown, don't let me drown

Hands up, give you all you'd never need
Don't need oxygen to bleed

I can touch but I can't feel
Bury me and make it real
(Hands up) Tied down
You don't want to let me drown, don't let me drown
