Yo Ned, turn that light down a little bit
Yeah

I don't care what we do I just have to know
I don't mean to rush her but I need to go
What does leave me broken, wounded, leaves me low
This is not me reaching
I'm not overthinking
There was only pieces, I think now I'm old
First time in a while that I've known control
I can't keep it simple, I can't keep it slow
Will you come relieve me?
This is not me leaving
Thought you knew it always
I'm here if you need me

I can say eye-to-eye
I don't see you enough
You're all that I think about
I never get home on time
(I can say eye-to-eye
I don't see you enough
You're all that I think about)

I don't care what we do I just have to know
I don't mean to rush her but I need to go
Should I pour us water? Should I charge my phone?

I can say eye-to-eye
I don't see you enough
You're all that I think about
I never get home on time
I can say eye-to-eye
I don't see you enough
You're all that I think about
I never get home on time

I can say eye-to-eye
I don't see you enough
You're all that I think about
I never get home on time
