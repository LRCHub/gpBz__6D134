Woo!
You know we in Berkely California right now Riding on the
Freeway Passing Emeryville,
Going through Oakland Shouts out to Richmond,
San Francisco One day to live,
Cause you living in the moment The past is the present,
The gift is my performance I'm working for the future,
Cause I live in a computer I could tell you things that I've seen A
Lot of guns in the streets, shattered dreams Spacebar, backspace,
Trace your steps I'm on the block like Jahvid Best Smoke a lot of
Weed have to calm my stress With the thought like no money came My
Thoughts is changed,
Step back I not my chains Sport pack like I"m out the game,
I'm out of your lane Think twice nigga,
Follow your brain I've got riches and I act the same Niggas is lame,
I'm too real, you want new chains?
Had to open my eyes since I got that fame Sit back in my partner's
Office Nigga laughing, reminiscing,
How I took them losses Then I promise one day,
If I took that loss Take the whole city back,
Open up that coffin No sir,
I don't believe in Jesus He was slaved to the world,
The books and preachers I feel weird cause I go against my own
Body Keep it too real, I got a new deal Niggas is fake,
But their money and their coupe real Actually,
What's the root of how you feel Found myself in church,
Paying respect To the Lord,
Like everyone else But the picture of the blond hair,
Blue eyes Is something that I ain't feeling I ain't saying that I
Can't But I ain't gon' be another slave to the race And I got friends
Around the world at 21 This is on my mind,
Practice forgiveness With nobody talking when I made the wishes for
Real, business Niggas fell down,
Hopped off those fences Feel bad because I made mistakes And still
Got raped by the system,
Still forgive 'em Spend your childhood in the courtroom system Fell
Down, nobody gonna pick 'em No money,
No lawyer gonna pick 'em And just forgive 'em,
Leaving the play nigga Leaving to die,
Leaving to ride I'm surprised he alive, for real,
You poor you die And rich get killed cause of money they got Man the
Sports get money while the doctors saving lives 9 to 5 can't even pay
The bills We need to manage the money for builders and plumbers,
Welders and purifiers The paper, the lover,
I might go to LA for the summer Venice
Beach music, open up the thunder, eternal slumber
